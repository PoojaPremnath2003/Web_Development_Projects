			<h3>My Experiences</h3>
			<p> I joined the school in June of 2012, in fourth grade.I graduated in 2021, amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic. </li>
			I thoroughly enjoyed the nine years that I spent here, especially my high school years. I have made numerous friends, 
			gained many valuable mentors and most importantly, spent most of my childhood years amidst an environment that has nurtured me into the adult I am today.
			My time at DAV has seen me go on yearly field trips, exhibitions, inter-house and inter-school competitions, and the hustle-bustle around my desk at lunchtime.
			Although my last year at school was spent in front of a laptop screen, the experience was no less in any sense, as even at home, I was surrounded by the support and 
			guidance of my teachers.
